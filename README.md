Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Luca Parolari, a PhD student at the University of Padova as part of the Visual Intelligence and Machine Perception ([VIMP](http://vimp.math.unipd.it/)) group. I primarily work with generative AI for dataset generation in the field of visual grounding. I'm currently learning and working object tracking and re-identification in colonoscopy videos. I have a deep fascination with blockchain technology and astronomy.
